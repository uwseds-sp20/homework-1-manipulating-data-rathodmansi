# HW1
Result:
We have performed an exploratory data analysis of the bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012. We have  observed features such as daily counts of bicylce cross the east and west

Problem Statement:
Obtain the CSV (comma separated variable) file containing the counts of bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012 (as described in https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k). Create a project directory with subdirectories for data and analysis, and create a README file. Download the data from https://data.seattle.gov/api/views/65db-xm6k/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD and put it in the data directory. Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze these data. In the notebook, complete the following:

1. Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe. (1 pt)
1. Add columns to the dataframe containing: ( 3 pt)
   1. The total (East + West) bicycle count
   1. The hour of the day
   1. The year
1. Create a dataframe with the subset of data from the year 2016 (1 pt)
1. Use pandas + matplotlib to plot the counts by hour. (i.e. hour of the day on the x-axis, total daily counts on the y-axis) (1 pt)
1. Use pandas to determine what is (on average) the busiest hour of the day (1 pt)
