# HW1

### Problem Statement:
Perform EDA on Fremont Bridge Data containing daily bicycle count. Work on following pointers using python:

1. Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe. (1 pt)
1. Add columns to the dataframe containing: ( 3 pt)
   1. The total (East + West) bicycle count
   1. The hour of the day
   1. The year
1. Create a dataframe with the subset of data from the year 2016 (1 pt)
1. Use pandas + matplotlib to plot the counts by hour. (i.e. hour of the day on the x-axis, total daily counts on the y-axis) (1 pt)
1. Use pandas to determine what is (on average) the busiest hour of the day (1 pt)

### Result:
We have performed an exploratory data analysis of the bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012. We have  observed features such as daily counts of bicylce cross the east and westb sidewalk. We have explored the hourwise bicycle crossings and what is the peak time of usage.
